# Hello! ✨

> There [was](https://github.com/t5r7/t5r7/blob/630551750b4f44bdc523fd1181ee885e620e7526/README.md) a list of projects here, but they're all getting on a bit now! Nowadays I mostly write scripts, small web toys, and [things](https://github.com/tomatport) for Uni. Feel free to browse my public repositories, but don't expect the highest code quality! Networking and infrastructure is more my thing!

🤔 Curious what `t5r7` means? It's a [numerical contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym#Numerical%20contractions), a type of numeronym. Think `i18n` or `k8s`.
