# Hello! ✨

> There was a list of projects here, but they're all getting on a bit now! Nowadays I mostly write scripts, small web toys, and things for Uni. Feel free to browse my public repositories, but don't expect the highest code quality! Networking and infrastructure is more my thing!

🤔 Curious what `t5r7` means? It's a [numerical contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym#Numerical%20contractions), a type of numeronym. Think `i18n` or `k8s`.
