# Hello! ✨
I am not a developer—networking and infrastructure is more my thing—but I do like making things sometimes!

There was a list of projects here, but they're all getting on a bit! Nowadays I mostly write scripts, small web toys, and things for Uni. Feel free to browse my public repositories, but don't expect the highest code quality!
